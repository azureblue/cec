\title{
Mouse set
}

\description{
Creates a matrix of \code{dim}-dimensional points that form a "mouse-like" set with uniform density.
}

\usage{
mouseset(n = 4000, r.head = 2, r.left.ear = 1.1, r.right.ear = 1.1, left.ear.dist = 2.5,
right.ear.dist = 2.5, dim = 2)
}

\arguments{

\item{n}{
Number of points to generate.
}

\item{r.head}{
Radius of mouse head.
}

\item{r.left.ear}{
Radius of mouse left ear.
}

\item{r.right.ear}{
Radius of mouse right ear.
}

\item{left.ear.dist}{
Distance between the center of the head and the center the left ear.
}

\item{right.ear.dist}{
Distance between the center of the head and the center the right ear.
}

\item{dim}{
Dimension of points.
}
}

\value{
Matrix of points with \code{n} rows and \code{dim} cols.
}
