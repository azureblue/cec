CEC
===

The R Package CEC performs clustering based on the crossâ€“entropy clustering (CEC) method, which was recently developed with the use of information theory. The main advantage of CEC is that it combines the speed and simplicity of k-means with the ability to use various Gaussian mixture models and reduce unnecessary clusters.

In the basic use of this package the input dataset <tt>data</tt> and the initial number <tt>centers</tt> of clusters: <br />
```R
cec(x = ..., centers = ...)
```
have to be specified. Below, a simple session with <tt>R</tt> is presented, where the component
(waiting) of the Old Faithful dataset is split into two clusters.
```R
library("CEC")
attach(faithful)
cec <- cec(matrix(faithful$waiting), 2)
print(cec)
```
