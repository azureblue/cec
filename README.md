CEC
===

The R Package CEC performs clustering based on the crossâ€“entropy clustering (CEC) method, which was recently developed with the use of information theory. The main advantage of CEC is that it combines the speed and simplicity of k-means with the ability to use various Gaussian mixture models and reduce unnecessary clusters.

In the basic use of this package the input dataset <tt>data</tt> and the initial number <tt>centers</tt> of clusters: <br />

```R
cec(x = ..., centers = ...)
```
have to be specified. Below, a simple session with <b>R</b> is presented, where the component
(waiting) of the Old Faithful dataset is split into two clusters.

```R
library("CEC")
attach(faithful)
cec <- cec(matrix(faithful$waiting), 2)
print(cec)
```

As its main outcome <b>CEC}</b> returns data cluster membership <tt>cec\$cluster</tt>. The following parameters of 
clusters are obtained as well:
<ul>
<li> a list of means <tt>cec\$centers</tt>, </li>
<li> a list of covariances <tt>cec\$covariances.model</tt> </li>
<li> a list of probabilities <tt>cec\$probability</tt>. </li>
</ul>

Some additional information concerning the number of iterations, cost (energy) function and the number of clusters during the following iterations is also obtained.

Below, a session of \proglang{R} is presented which shows how to use the above parameters for plotting the data and the Gaussian models corresponding to the clusters.

```R
hist(faithful$waiting, prob = TRUE, main = "Histogram of Time between Old Faithful eruptions", xlab = "Minutes", ylim = c(0, 0.05));
for(i in c(1:2)){
  curve(cec$probability[i] * dnorm(x, mean = cec$centers[i], sd = sqrt(cec$covariances[[i]][1])), add = T, col = i + 1)  
}
```
